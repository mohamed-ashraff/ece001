                            Python is the world's fast-growing programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum released in 1991. Python solves complex problems in a few lines and saves developers time. Python is not only for software developers but also for data analysts, scientist and network engineers. Python is a simpler, clean and beginner-friendly programming language. Python use in AI, ML, web application, desktop application, mobile applications, and automation.

                            Is java pure object-oriented? Java language is one of the most popular programming languages for general purposes. Java is created in 1995 and owned by Oracle. Java is Object Oriented Programming Language but it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types like int, float, etc. Java is used to develop web applications, smartphone applications, databases, games, and so on. Some important characteristics are easy to learn if you have knowledge about programming, fast, secure, powerful, and free. it provides reusability because it is object-oriented and low the development cost and most of the devices run on java.

In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named "C++".
