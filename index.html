        <h2  style="color: crimson;text-decoration: underline;">Introduction of programming language</h2>
        <br>
        <p >
            A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

            Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[2] The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.
            
            Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
            
            The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

        <br>
        <p >
            The most important thing you should know about programming languages is this:

            Programming languages allow us to communicate with computers through computer code.
            
            Each programming language is simply a means to tell a computer what it should do. It’s a language your computer understands and knows how to process.
            
            When you learn a specific programming language, it’s a lot like learning any other language. You need to understand how the language works and follow a certain set of rules, much like grammar in spoken languages.
            
            Each language is different and you’ll use them for different types of projects.

            One important practical objective for this course is to help you learn how to learn programminglanguages. Inevitably, if you are to have a career in software engineering work, you will have to learn newprogramming languages at various times.One way to develop your ability to learn languages is simply to learn several of them. Learning the firstone is hard, the next one often not so hard and so on. After you've learned several, you will feel thatlearning new ones is a snap: you just learn to cope with some new syntax and you're set.But is that really true? It depends. The problem is that you may have learned to work with severallanguages that are only slightly different from each other. For example, if you've learned some olderlanguages such as FORTRAN, BASIC, PL/I, Pascal, C and Modula-2, you will have seen only a small part of the spectrum of concepts underlying modern programming languages. In short, you will haveconsiderable experience in learning the
            imperative
            or procedural style of programming, but very littleknowledge of object-oriented, functional or logic programming languages.In this course, we focus on a systematic way of helping you learn how to learn new languages. Part of thiswill be to survey the spectrum of different programming paradigms and how they may be supported byprogramming languages. A second aspect of our survey will be to examine important programminglanguage issues: distinctions that may be found between existing languages in the same class. Thisfoundation of broad knowledge about programming language paradigms and issues should provide youthe best preparation for learning new languages quickly.

        <h2  style="color: crimson;text-decoration: underline;">How does a programming language work? </h2>
        <br>
        <p >
            A program is a set of instruction that the computer follows to perform a given task. A programming language is a formal language for instructing a computer to perform this given task. How does a programming language work ? Okay, when you run your program each line of code is converted into machine instruction. We are now in the Central Processing unit now. Here each machine instruction is now converted to microinstructions. Which includes things like fetching the operands used in your original program and other primitive operations and tasks like fetching data, executing operations on data. It is like another lower programming language in your processor is running under your High Level Language such as Java. In other words your processor is using its own language to execute your program. Your High Level Language you use in writing the program is not concerned with these primitive tasks like fetching operands used in your program or fetching data.
